Botcon - instant message bot with machine remote control
========================================================

ABOUT:
======

Botcon allows you to execute a shell remotely through a xmmp connection. Using a
common xmpp server account, you can add the bot as your friend and send commands
to him that will be by passed to a shell on the machine that Botcon is running.

Before you can access the shell, you need to make login inside the bot, sending
the follow command:

	#login <key>

Where <key> is the access key (password) provided as a argument of Botcon. For
more information just type:

	botcon --help


HOW TO INSTALL:
===============

	./configure
	make
	make install


NOTES:
======

This is just a proof of concept. Botcon it's really in a alpha version and 
should not be used in a production system, and never as a "ssh" like to make remote
control due security issues.

Botcon it's still unsecure and unstable. Please, use just for tests and for
education purposes.
